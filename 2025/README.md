# Advent of Code 2025 Solutions

This directory contains my solutions for
[Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025).

## Goals

Like with recent years I'm aiming for correctness, a sub 1s total runtime,
algorithmic efficiency, and readability in that order. Where possible I aim
for solutions that work for any conceivable inputs, but when that's
impractical, I want solutions to at least fail loudly on inputs they can't
handle correctly.

## Performance

| Day | Runtime |
| --- | ------: |
| 1   |   0.6ms |

Total Runtime: 0.6ms
