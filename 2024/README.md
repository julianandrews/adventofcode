# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

This directory contains my solutions for
[Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## Goals

Like with recent years I'm aiming for correctness, a sub 1s total runtime,
algorithmic efficiency, and readability in that order. Where possible I aim
for solutions that work for any conceivable inputs, but when that's
impractical, I want solutions to at least fail loudly on inputs they can't
handle correctly.
