# Advent of Code 2023 Solutions

This directory contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

Like last year, I'm aiming for sub 1s total runtime. Correctness, algorithmic
efficiency and readability are my priorities, in that order. I will generally
avoid optimizations that hurt readability without substantially improving
runtime, but won't avoid added complexity if the performance gain is
substantial.

## Performance

| 5   |   0.5ms |
| 6   |   0.5ms |
| 7   |   0.9ms |
| 8   |   5.0ms |
| 9   |   0.7ms |
| 10  |   1.5ms |
| 11  |   1.1ms |
| 12  |   9.1ms |
| 13  |   0.6ms |
| 14  |   7.5ms |
| 15  |   0.9ms |
| 16  |  20.8ms |
| 17  |  32.6ms |
| 18  |   0.5ms |
| 19  |   1.3ms |
| 20  |   2.8ms |
| 21  |  11.4ms |
