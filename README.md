# Advent of Code

My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

I do Advent of Code to scratch the OCD itch, so I aim for clean, correct,
readable code over concise or clever code.

From 2020 onwards solutions are all in Rust. I did the early years in Python,
but have gone back and reworked a bunch in other languages for practice.
Eventually I may redo all the problems in Rust.

From 2022 onwards I've set myself the goal of efficient solutions with sub-1s
total runtime. I'm not trying to write the fastest possible solutions and I
don't compromise on correctness for speed, but I aim for clean implementations
of optimal algorithms. I prefer solutions that will work for any conceivable
inputs, but will compromise if the problem isn't tractable for all inputs.
