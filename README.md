My [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) solutions.

Solutions are organized by year.

## History

- [2017](2017) - Started solving the problems in Python
- [2018](2018) - Got addicted and went back and solved [2015](2015) and
  [2016](2016), still mostly in Python, but sometimes re-doing problems in C++
  or Rust for practice
- [2019](2019) - Added Go to the mix of languages I was playing with
- [2020](2020) - I was pretty well addicted to Rust by now. All Rust!
- [2021](2021) - More Rust! I lost steam towards the end, but finally finished up in 2023.
- [2022](2022) - All parts in Rust! I set a goal of sub 1s total runtime.
- [2023](2023) - Still more Rust. Once again aiming for sub 1s total runtime.
